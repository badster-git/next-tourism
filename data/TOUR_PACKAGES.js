After learning the story behind the world's most recognizable statue, you'll also see some of Michelangelo's unfinished Slaves for a fascinating peek inside the tortured mind of the great artist. Having an expert art historian on hand pays dividends here - Michelangelo was not just the most talented artist to come out of the Renaissance, he was also the most fascinating. Who else would defy a pope? And more than once!",
              "After the Accademia, your Florence In A Day Tour continues to the Cathedral, a.k.a. Florence Duomo, where your guide will tell you the story of its enormous dome and how it went from a near catastrophe to the greatest building achievement of its age. You'll also see the Florence Baptistery, home to the set of bronze doors that were thought so beautiful, Michelangelo called them the 'Gates of Paradise'.",

The Uffizi makes for a fantastic visit because its galleries are organized chronologically. As you move through the rooms, your guide will be able to demonstrate the development of artistic styles from Medieval times to the Renaissance and after. They'll show you how modern paintings bursting with colors and emotions developed from the flat, cold, compositions of the middle ages. Don't expect a lecture: our guides are much more fun than that. Their focus is on injecting character into your experience of the Uffizi (and everywhere else), so you understand not just the paintings, but the masters and the culture that created them.",
              "Florence is one of Italy's most atmospheric cities and its streets are bursting with history and beautiful architecture. Outside of the obvious big attractions, this is a big part of your Florence In A Day Tour: street life. You'll enjoy a guided walking tour of the city, visit an outdoor sculpture gallery, a leather market, the remarkable Ponte Vecchio and see the Vasari Corridor, made famous by Dan Brown, from outside (the inside is rather unremarkable anyway). You'll hear tales of the notorious Medici family outside their fortress-like palace, and come to understand why it was Florence, not Rome, that was the cradle of the Renaissance.",

For most of the day, her room in the Louvre is packed to the brim with people jostling to get a peek at her. However our expert guides have created specially-timed itineraries that allow you to see the Mona Lisa at the best possible time. Enjoy some peaceful moments with the mysterious lady and your knowledgeable tour guide. You'll be able to get close enough to see her tiny canvas - and even snap a photo or two with the Louvre's leading lady.",
              "The itinerary of our Louvre tour has been tested over countless visits to ensure you get a full two hours and 30 minutes inside the galleries.

These canvases are the perfect jumping-off point into conversations about France's fascinating history. As you admire these stunning artworks, your guide will decode Delacroix's message from the French Revolution and Géricault devastating portrayal of a real-life event.

As you move from one stunning room to the next, your guide will give you the history of the building - once a royal residence where one young prince in particular rode his horse up and down the corridors. At times, it will be hard to take you eyes off the architecture to focus on the art - just another reason why this is one of the world's greatest art museums.",

Inside you'll see beautiful gothic architecture along with much grimmer touches, like a human 'hamster wheel' that was used by convicts imprisoned in the Abbey after the French Revolution to haul goods up the cliff sides. The highlight of the building is its highest tower, which, on a clear day, affords you 360-degree views for miles around the bay and surrounding countryside. It's not hard to see why so many have wanted to control this tiny rock throughout the centuries.",

With private transport between sites, you’ll cover more ground than would be possible even in a whole day on your own.",

A highlight is the roof, designed to resemble the scales of a dragon – the great emblem of Barcelona.",

You’ll see this clearly on our next two visits, first hitting the Casa Mila (La Pedrera) and then at Casa Vincens, each characterized by varied skills of this incomparable genius.",

We will also pause in front of the absolute best vantage point in Barcelona.",

It can be hard to know where to look on your first visit to La Sagrada Família, so it’s lucky you have a Gaudí expert on hand to guide your experience. In the final years of the architect’s life he abandoned all other projects, and much of his life in general, to work on this magnificent and completely unique church. He even went door to door collecting donations and moved into its basement so he could work around the clock. It’s an incredible representation of everything that made him such a unique talent – so much detail and symbolism, blending the natural and human world together in a riot of colors, shapes, and characters. You’ll spend a full hour exploring the church itself, from its detailed façade to the stained glass windows inside.",

              "Begin your tour in front of the Cathedral of Santa Maria of Palma (La Seu), the city’s premier church since the Crown of Aragon erected it on the site of a former Moorish-era mosque, replacing the Muslim faith that once dominated the city with the Christian. Wander through the interior of the church, setting the tone for the history and culture of this dynamic retreat city. Learn of its Gothic architecture and almost 400 years of construction, including the rift between artist Antoni Gaudi and the contractor that led to his abandonment of restoring the Cathedral.",
              "From here, make your way through to the nearby Royal Palace of La Almudaina, just on the banks of the Bay with its turrets, crenel and merlons reaching into the lapis sky over Mallorca. Explore the exterior as your expert guide offers stories of the Royal Family, and the many interesting architectural features.",
              "You have put in some hard work so far - so it is time for a break and the Ca’n Joan De S’aigo is just the place - a beloved ice cream and pastry (sounds good to me!) venue where we will taste an ensaimada, a truly local Palma treat. After these refreshing goodies, it’s back to the streets to make our way to the Monastery of Sant Francesc. Not only will we visit the interior of this beautiful space to marvel before the sandstone cloister with its lush orange and lemon trees, but also taste the olive oil produced locally in Palma.",
              "From here, there are a few more enticing things to see and your guide by now has made you fall in love with sunny Palma (if you weren’t already before). With a stop at humble, but no less beautiful and quiet Santa Eulalia church and then the sweeping Plaza Mayor, your day will simply seem just perfect. At Plaza del Mercat, a small square with the traditional vibe of the city, your guide will begin to wrap up your day - touching on the history showcased here. For your final destination, the Plaza de las Tortugas where a few surprise features in the central fountain will reveal the long and touching history of the city and its residents.",

            tourDescription: [
              "This full-day London City Tour begins with first-entry into Westminster Abbey, which means you'll get inside before most of the crowds show up. As you wander through its jaw-dropping, gothic nave, your guide will tell you the story of its rich and tumultuous history, pointing out all the historical details packed into every surface and corner. There are ancient orders of chivalry, tombs of people like Isaac Newton and Charles Dickens, and of course, all the details from the royal weddings. Whether you are a devotee of English history or just love a great story, this is one of the most compelling buildings in the UK.",
              "When you leave the Abbey you'll cross St. James's Park and head over to Wellington Barracks. While the crowds jostle each other to watch the Changing of the Guard in front of Buckingham Palace you'll see an even better version of the ceremony from your vantage point near the Barracks. It's here that the guards - who have been protecting the monarch for over 400 years - go through their elaborate preparations and uniform checks as a military band plays them out. Nowhere are ancient traditions on better display and you'll see them all from just a few paces away. If you go on a Saturday there is no changing of the guard, so your guide will show you Buckingham Palace and tell you all about its history as a royal residence.",
              "On the other side of St. James's Park, you'll see a much less famous but arguably more impressive guard changing; that of the Queen's Life Guard. These mounted cavalrymen appear on beautifully-bred horses and complete a highly ritualized ceremony in the aptly named Horse Guards Parade. As they go through the motions your guide will explain the illustrious history of these special military units and why they continue to perform traditions dating back hundreds of years.",
              "From the Horse Guards Parade you'll walk over to Trafalgar Square, the historic central point of London. Standing beneath the famous lions that flank Nelson's Column, you'll learn about the navy that spread British influence around the globe, as well as the celebrity Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson whose fame, in his own time, rivaled that of any present-day celebrity. There are also a couple of surprises scattered around the square, like a tiny patch of American soil, and the smallest police box ever made.",
              "You'll break for lunch around midday (don't forget to ask your guide for restaurant recommendations; they know the area well and can direct you to the best spots). After lunch you'll head down to the Thames to enjoy a scenic river cruise east past landmarks like the London Eye, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Shard and the Gherkin. The most iconic of them all is the Tower Bridge, which you'll walk across as your guide gives you the surprising history of this iconic sight (hint: it's not as old you might think).",
              "The views (and pictures) from the bridge are lovely, but something even better is awaiting you on the other side where you'll use pre-reserved tickets to stroll past the crowds and begin a guided Tower of London tour. The first thing you'll notice is that it doesn't look like a tower. In fact, it was a fortress and royal stronghold for British monarchs for some 1,000 years. The history of the Tower of London is steeped in dark tales of imprisonment, torture, ghosts, jailbreaks, and royal blood feuds. These walls have seen scores of executions, murders, and strange disappearances. Heck, there was even a zoo here for many years.",
              "Your guide will tell you the Tower's story, including everything from humorous anecdotes about the King's menagerie, to the grim story of two possible heirs to the throne who never made it out. This is British royal history at its most entertaining, a favorite for both children and history buffs alike.",
              "To finish your Tower of London tour in style, your guide will direct you to the Crown Jewels - the largest collection of coronation regalia in the world. Although your guide is not allowed to accompany you inside, they will give you the stories and backgrounds of the must-see pieces so when you see them, their significance will be that much more apparent.",

There are national heroes, like Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton buried in the crypts, stories of Royal Weddings floating around the altar, traditions, strange lore, and semi-secret societies hiding in every work of art. The history of the UK and its rulers is intimately linked to this building, so seeing it without the crowds is a real treat.",

This ancient meeting place has been hosting political functions for nearly 1,000 years and still retains its original Medieval architecture. As you stand beneath the titanic timbers of the hammerbeam roof, your guide will introduce you to the history of the building, which has survived all manner of fire, upheaval, and even a Medieval terrorist plot. You'll also learn about Parliament's relationship with the monarchy as you peek into the antechamber in which the Queen dons her crown and ermine-trimmed cape before she opens the new sessions each year.",
              "You'll also step into the Chamber of the House of Lords, the unelected Upper House, and one of the most impressive rooms in the palace. Membership used to be an entitlement of all hereditary peers, but these days there are only about 90 people who have inherited their titles and all the others are appointed experts in their fields. Your guide will tell you how and why this system changed, as well as the difficulties of modernizing a thoroughly ancient institution.",
              "You won't just see the most famous rooms; we'll also show you around areas that even TV cameras don't visit, like the Division Lobbies, where the politicians divide themselves before a vote based on an old Roman tradition.",

This is the engine room of British democracy and one of the most exciting spots on your Houses of Parliament tour. The stories that have come from this place - from the abolition of slavery in Britain, to the decisions that drove the Brexit referendum, will make your hair stand on end. As an interesting twist, this is the one place on the British Isles that the Queen isn't allowed to enter, though the reason why might surprise you.",

You’ll be able to trace their footsteps inside as you admire the high vaulted ceilings, and ornately carved interior.
