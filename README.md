## ðŸ”Ž What does it do?

At the moment it allows a user to view different tours from different countries that were fetched from a local file. It uses lunr for the search functionality that matches up queries with text found in the index used by lunr. The mailsletter component allows a user to subscribe to my newsletter with the Mailchimp API and the **`subscribe`** file found in **`src/pages/api`**. Lunr uses a search API that's located in the **`src/pages/api`** section to create a lunr index with a refs and fields.
